## Project Description
This project lets you generate Halo2 verifier contracts in Rust for Arbitrum Stylus.


## Tech Stack
- Halo2
- Arbitrum Stylus



## Objectives
- Being able to generate EZKL verifier contracts in Rust for Arbitrum Stylus.




## Weekly Progress

### Week 1 (ends Oct 31)
**Goals:**

**Progress Summary:**  


### Week 2 (ends Nov 7)
**Goals:**  
Solve an issue found when building different projects. The ezkl verification contract is just generated in Solidity. So it would be very useful to be able to take advantage of Arbitrum Stylus enhanchements for this.
**Progress Summary:**  
Advances in research to implement within the limits that Stylus has defined (like WASM size).

### 🗓️ Week 3 (ends Nov 14)
**Goals:**  

**Progress Summary:**
