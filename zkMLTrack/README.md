##  Project Title
zkMLTrack
zk-verified version control for AI model evolution


## Team
- Team/Individual Name: AIZK
- GitHub Handles: cesarsiuu2316, cooldev1337
- Devfolio Handles: cesar23, web3path

## Project Description
This project introduces an on-chain version control system for AI model evolution, where each new version is recorded only after proving improved accuracy on a validation set through zero-knowledge proofs. Once the proof is verified, the model’s hash is updated on-chain, creating a verifiable record of performance across model versions.


## Tech Stack
- PyTorch
- EZKL
- Arbitrum Stylus



## Objectives
- Deploy a smart contract on Arbitrum Stylus
- Verify model performance with zero-knowledge proofs
- Track AI model evolution securely




## Weekly Progress

### Week 1 (ends Oct 31)
**Goals:**
Find a good use case to zkML.
**Progress Summary:**  
Narrowing to PyTorch proofs
Choosing a project and brainstorming ideas to make it happen.

### Week 2 (ends Nov 7)
**Goals:**  
Research and establish steps to achieve the completion of the project and determined it's scope. Also, started experimenting with the libraries and frameworks in the stack.
**Progress Summary:**  
Defined project with scope
Experimentation with ezkl and ezkljs web target for the frontend to generate proofs and a backend to deploy the verifier contract.

### 🗓️ Week 3 (ends Nov 14)
**Goals:**  

**Progress Summary:**
