## Project Description
This project introduces an on-chain version control system for AI model evolution, where each new version is recorded only after proving improved accuracy on a validation set through zero-knowledge proofs. Once the proof is verified, the modelâ€™s hash is updated on-chain, creating a verifiable record of performance across model versions.

## Tech Stack
- PyTorch
- EZKL
- Arbitrum Stylus

## Objectives
- Deploy a smart contract on Arbitrum Stylus
- Verify model performance with zero-knowledge proofs
- Track AI model evolution securely
